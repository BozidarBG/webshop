Hello :)

This is my fourth app and it is a webshop.

It was made using Laravel, jQuery and Ajax, with Laravel Voyager, Stripe payment and Electro Store frontend theme from http://w3layouts.com.  

User can:<br>
- register and login before ordering products<br>
- order products and pay with credit cart (you can enter 4242 4242 4242 4242 2/22/222 to test purchase)<br>
- view orders on profile page<br>
- ask question on Contact Us page<br>

Moderator can:<br>
- CRUD products<br>
- see orders and update delivery status<br>

Administrator can:<br>
- change user roles<br>
- CRUD with categories<br>
- CRUD brands<br>
- change site settings<br>
- change content of the slider<br>
- answer questions submitted by users<br>

You can see it live on https://bozidar-webshop.000webhostapp.com
